# IExec architecture and functionalities


IExec is a new paradigm for cloud computing. Cloud resources can now be traded on a global market.


## IExec Dapps
The IExec Dapps architecture is based on 3 main components.
### Application providers
In ann application providers that give users the possibility to monetize apps, Dapps, functions, or algorithms.
### Computing providers
No more CPU cycle wasted! Computing providers can make the most of their servers, by joining the iExec network and renting them.(docs)
### Data providers
Data is the new gold! Data providers can monetize datasets usage and open up new revenue streams for their assets. A single entity can be all types of providers at the same time.(docs)
## Lottery Dapps
to deploy the lottery Dapps, we will use the IExec application providers, by using the below four steps:


- Tools to deploy Dapps to IExec store(IExec cli)
- An unified executable environments (Docker)
- A tool to get the result and execution logs


## Lottery Dapps
Once the contract is deployed, we will create a Dapp that invokes the smart contracts. IExec users can borrow those smart contracts and Dapps to use them for their own interests against an IExec token.


To build those apps we will need:


- Create a dockerfile for the Dapps.
- Initiate the IExec account by creating a new wallet.
- Deployed the Dapps using IExec cli.
